## Projects

- **[Ricky - Interdimensional Personal Assistant Chatbot](https://github.com/EphronM/RICKY---Assistant)**
  - Developed an advanced personal assistant chatbot with Mistral LLM, embodying the character and persona of Rick Sanchez from the famous TV series "Rick and Morty."
  - Containerized the chatbot with Docker, establishing a CI/CD pipeline via GitHub Actions for automated deployment. Utilized AWS ECR to host Docker images on EC2 instances for public access. Integrated continuous monitoring with Comet ML for real-time chatbot performance and interaction analysis.

- **[Invoice Extraction System using Gemini Vision Pro](https://github.com/EphronM/Invoice_parser.git)**
  - Developed an Invoice extractor using Gemini Vision Pro to extract vital invoice details from images and text, Dockerizing it for streamlined deployment. Integrated GitHub Runners for automated builds and AWS Elastic Container Registry for hosting on EC2 instances.

- **[Custom Dataset Fine-tuning of Llama 2 Model with PEFT - QLoRA](https://github.com/EphronM/Retraining_llm)**
  - Retrained Llama 2 model on custom dataset using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques like QLoRA, quantizing the 7b parameters model to 4-bit precision using T4 GPU on Colab. Published the fine-tuned model on the Hugging Face repo for public access.
